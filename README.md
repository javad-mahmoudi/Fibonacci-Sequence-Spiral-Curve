Hey!
Here there is very simple code for having a spiral visualizatiion of Fibonacci Sequence.
as a background information, only open the code and press run then follow belows:
1: after running you will see a window as a view of curve animation.
2. app asks you for input the sequence number, please enter an integer number as you want.
3. press enter and open the window for having fun with drawing the FiboSequence as an animation.

Point: the animation window would be open at the same time when you should enter the sequence numebr, hence easily minimize or click on input order without closing the animation window!!
